## 🌱 My Journey
I recently graduated in **Computer Science** 🎓, and I'm still figuring out which specialty excites me the most. So, what’s the plan? **Try everything**! 🚀 This is my journey of exploration—where every line of code is an adventure.

Currently, I'm part of the **42 Network** (yeah, the one where we code, debug, and try not to lose our sanity 😅) learning **C**. Let’s just say pointers are… interesting. 🔍

## 🚀 My Learning Adventures
- 📖 **Learning C**: I’m tackling the fundamentals one line at a time. 💪
- 🌌 Exploring **different domains** like:
  - 🔐 **Cybersecurity**: Because who doesn’t want to be a hacker for the good guys?
  - 🤖 **AI & ML**: Making machines smarter (or trying to).
  - 💻 **Full-Stack Development**: Web magic ✨, backend power ⚡, and a bit of CSS chaos.

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On
- **libft**: Currently, I'm working on building my own library in **C** that includes custom versions of common functions—basically re-inventing the wheel and learning a ton while I do it! 🛞✨

## 🚧 The “Try Everything” Plan
- **Backend & APIs**: Because data and logic are cool.
- **Mobile Apps**: Gotta bring ideas to your pocket, right?
- **DevOps**: Maybe I like servers more than I think?

Who knows where this journey will take me, but I’m ready to **learn**, **build**, and **have fun** with whatever comes next! 🎉
